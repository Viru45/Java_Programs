/* 
---------Dynamic Method Dispatch-----------------Run Time Polymorphism Ex.

Dynamic Method Dispatch (DMD) is a process in Java where a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime (not at compile time). 
It allows Java to support runtime polymorphism â€” that is, the ability to call the correct version of a method based on 
the actual object type, not the reference type.
Simply put: You decide which method to run depending on the object you created, not the reference you use.
